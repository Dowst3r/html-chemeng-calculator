    <h1>Intro to me and the calculator:</h1>
    <!-- This goes from 1 to 6, chose based on their importance, size can be changed with CSS! -->

    <!-- you use class to define groups of things, as calling p, would result in all paragraph based things being called and so need specific names for bits to make sure they are called correctly -->
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! This website can be used to calculate things that
      are commonly required in Chemcial Engineering that run the risk of human
      error. I made this website to allow people to check if their answers are
      correct <em class="who-for">(mostly for students!)</em>, but also for
      anyone who has a calulcation they need to do. Happy calculating!
    </p>
    <!-- can bring up the command pallet (ctrl shift P) and use the wrap with Abbreviation command to use "em" to wrap a bit of text in em so you dont run into the risk of messing up -->
